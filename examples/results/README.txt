This folder contains all data and scripts necessary to reproduce the figures
in the ACE article and supplementary material.

with the concrete results in the Fig* subdirectories from the directory 
containing the file you are reading.

contained in the "results/Fig_2_resonantlevelmodel" directory, and so on.
